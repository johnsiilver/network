Throw away your individual scripts that all implement slightly different methods for sending command, configurations, or files to your network device.  \r\n\r\nBuilt for scale, this service scales to thousands of nodes and is perfect for your kubernetes/docker installation.  And security doesn't take a backseat.  Certificate support built in for service access and user/pass or SSH keys for device access (user/pass, can you believe still a necessary evil in 2016).\r\n\r\n### Built on Go\r\nAll tooling in the Network toolkit is built in the Go language.  Go is fast, scalable and easy to deploy (no need to install an interpreter).  This makes installing toolkit components much easier.  If your not familiar with Go, more information can be found at: http://www.golang.org . \r\n\r\nThere is a very small but growing number of network automation tooling frameworks written in scripting languages such as Python that plugin to larger frameworks such as Ansible (also in Python).  All services are exposed via Google's GRPC library, allowing all major languages access to the infrastructure.  We currently only provide client wrappers in Go, but will extend them to other libraries in the future.  \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAuthor - John Doak (@johnsiilver)",
