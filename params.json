  "body": "### Welcome to the Network Toolkit.\r\nThe Network Toolkit provides various resources for automating network services used in enterprise, internet providers, and within the cloud space.\r\n\r\n### Valet - Network Communication Service\r\nValet, our first tool in the stack, simply abstracts communicating with network devices into a service with a simple API.\r\n\r\nThis abstraction is powerful, allowing a central location of access control to all automations.  Throw away your individual scripts that all implement slightly different methods for sending command, configurations, or files to your network device.  \r\n\r\nBuilt for scale, this service scales to thousands of nodes and is perfect for your kubernetes/docker installation.  And security doesn't take a backseat.  With built in certificate support for service access and user/pass or SSH keys for device access, we have you secured for modern and legacy devices.\r\n\r\n### Built on Go\r\nThe Network toolkit is built in the Go language, a modern, fast, scalable language.  Developed for the needs of infrastructure programming at Google scale, it allows easy to deployment via binaries (no need to install an interpreter on target systems).  If your not familiar with Go, more information can be found at: http://www.golang.org . \r\n\r\nThere is a very small but growing number of network automation tooling frameworks written in scripting languages such as Python that plugin to larger frameworks such as Ansible.  Network Toolkit services are exposed via Google's GRPC library, allowing all major languages access to the infrastructure. \r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\nEverything here is licensed via the Apache 2.0 license.
